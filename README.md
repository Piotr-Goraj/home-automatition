# Summary

Its main goal is to build a web app for home automation which can be use on multi platforms like PC or mobile.

One of tasks is create a local server that handles requests for frontend applications created.The front-line tasks will include creating an application that supports switching on the lights in the staircase (this will also be divided into the ESP microcontroller support module). The second application is to be an app responsible for automating the operation of the aquarium. All applications will work separately but will be the body of one larger front-end application.
